## Background and Intro

Social media advertising is a growing industry. Given the importance of social media in a consumer’s daily life, over [90% of advertisers are willing to advertise on social media.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/736971/social-media-ad-spend-usa/) By 2022, companies are projected to spend over [$56 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/736971/social-media-ad-spend-usa/) on social media advertising. This trend is also reflected in the political sphere. In 2016, political candidates spent [$1.4 billion](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/political-advertising-on-social-media-platforms/) on social media advertising, compared to just $22.5 million just 8 years prior. Given this heavy investment in social media advertising, political campaigns need to ensure that they are optimizing their ad approach for the greatest reach.
